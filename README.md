## Project Goals
- Build a functional and responsive web application  
- Practice full-stack development with modern technologies  
- Implement authentication, database integration, and booking features  
- Gain experience with version control and deployment workflows  

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or similar framework)   
- **Digitaltoolsn**: Figma for UI/UX design 
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

### Importance of Identifying Design Properties
Identifying the design properties of a mockup is crucial because:  
- It ensures **consistency** across the application, keeping the UI visually cohesive.  
- Developers can **accurately translate the design** into code without guessing colors, fonts, or spacing.  
- It helps in maintaining **brand identity** and a professional look.  
- Reduces **design-to-development friction**, speeding up implementation.  
- Makes it easier to **update or scale** the design in future iterations.
